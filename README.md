# Weather Dashboard for Trip Planning

This homework assignment involves building a weather dashboard application that allows travelers to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. The dashboard runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. By using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API from OpenWeatherMap, the application retrieves weather data for cities and presents current and future weather conditions.

## Summary

The weather dashboard accomplishes the following:

- Users can search for a city using the provided form inputs, triggering the display of current and future weather conditions for that city.

- The searched city is added to the search history, allowing users to easily access previously searched cities.

- Current weather conditions for the selected city are presented, including the city name, date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

- Future weather conditions for the selected city are displayed as a 5-day forecast, showing the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

- By clicking on a city in the search history, users can view the current and future weather conditions for that city again.

By developing this weather dashboard application, travelers can conveniently plan their trips by accessing up-to-date weather information for multiple cities. The application allows users to quickly view essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, helping them make informed decisions about their travel plans. The search history feature enables easy access to previously searched cities, allowing users to compare weather conditions and plan their itinerary accordingly.
